🧩 How the app works (step-by-step)

1. Navbar

Just the top bar with the app name — for design consistency.

<Navbar />

2. Timer (the heart of the app)

This is the main part of the app where all the logic happens.

When you first open it:

You’ll see something like:

Work Session
25:00
[Start] [Reset]

Start begins the countdown.

Pause (same button) stops the countdown temporarily.

Reset resets it back to your chosen work time.

When time runs out, it switches automatically to a “Break” phase.

You can also click Settings to adjust:

Work time (1–60 minutes)

Break time (5–10 minutes)

What you’ll do during your break (e.g., “Grab a snack”)

All this is stored in localStorage, so your settings stay even after refreshing.

3. Session Counter

This part (on the right) shows how many work sessions you’ve finished.

After every completed work session, this number goes up by 1.

It’s also saved in localStorage so it stays between page reloads.

4. The Flow

Here’s what happens in real use:

Phase What you see What happens
Work Countdown (25:00 → 0:00) You focus and work
Time hits 0 Switches to Break The app pauses — waiting for you to start your break
Break Countdown (e.g., 5:00 → 0:00) You rest
Time hits 0 Switches back to Work Repeat cycle 5. Behind the scenes

The timer runs using setInterval() in React:

Every 1 second, it subtracts 1 from remaining time.

When remaining hits 0, it switches to the next phase.

6. Styling

Everything you see (dark background, glowing buttons, modal) is handled inside index.css.
No frameworks (like Material UI or Bootstrap) — just plain CSS.

⚙️ How to Run It

If you haven’t run it yet, here’s what to do:

npx create-react-app pomodoro
cd pomodoro
npm install react-router-dom

Then replace:

src/App.js

src/pages/Home.js

src/components/ folder (create it)

src/index.css

Finally, run:

npm start

And open http://localhost:3000
— your Pomodoro timer will appear.
